# Predictive Maintenance System using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Predictive Maintenance System using deep learning techniques. Predictive maintenance aims to predict when an equipment failure might occur, so maintenance can be performed just in time to avoid downtime and reduce costs.

## Description

In industrial settings, unplanned equipment failures can lead to significant downtime and maintenance costs. This project leverages historical and real-time sensor data to predict potential equipment failures using advanced deep learning models. By accurately predicting failures, maintenance can be scheduled proactively, ensuring continuous operation and reducing overall costs.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

Open the `Predictive Maintenance System using Deep Learning.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions provided in the cells. The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project.
2. **Data Loading**: Load and inspect the dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Generate features for the model.
5. **Model Building**: Build and train the deep learning model.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance.
7. **Visualization**: Visualize the results.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of sensor readings from industrial equipment. Each record includes various sensor measurements and the corresponding label indicating whether a failure occurred.

- **Sensors**: Various sensor readings (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration).
- **Labels**: Binary labels indicating failure (1) or normal operation (0).

## Model Training

The notebook includes code for training a deep learning model, specifically an LSTM or GRU, to predict equipment failures based on sensor data. The model is trained using the processed features and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, ROC curves and confusion matrices are plotted to visualize the results.

## Results

The results of the model, including evaluation metrics and visualizations, are presented in the notebook. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive maintenance system in identifying potential equipment failures.
